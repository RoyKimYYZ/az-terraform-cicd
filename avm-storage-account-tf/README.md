### Objectives

*
Scenario: Deploy a storage account with a blob container.


Note: 
*  terraform ignores subfolders
*  terraform tf files can be organized and split up with any file naming convention. terraform will look at all tf files together and figure out order of operations. E.g. you don't have to have an explicit main.tf or explicit variables.tf
