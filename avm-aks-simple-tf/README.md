To get started on the Azure Verified Modules (AVM) for AKS I like to show a series of examples from most simplest to more sophisticated scenarios. The AVM module is called `avm-res-containerservice-managedcluster` This wil help get used to using AVM modules for AKS.

| Code Sample | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
