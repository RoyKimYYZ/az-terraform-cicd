# Objective

This repo is a series of my own code samples exhibiting various technical patterns, designs, techniques and scenarios. 

My code is comprehensively commented to explain how the code works so you have a deeper understanding. 

| Code Sample | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| __[azurerm-tf-starter](https://github.com/RoyKimYYZ/az-terraform-cicd/tree/main/azurerm-tf-starter)__   | As there are many ways to structure a terraform project, I am showing on example for a beginner and simple scenario. I am deploying a storage account. Along with a blob container wrapped as a terraform module for purposes of reusability and modularity. |
